# [Virology Lectures by Vincent Racaniello, (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhmZX2NKiNldpyRUBBEzNoWL0Cso1jip)

## Lecture 1: What is a Virus?

* Just like we have a microbiome, we also have a virome.
* The human genome has 3.2 billion bases out of which 8.3% are LTR transposons (remainders of retroviruses).
* Amazingly, the vast majority of the viruses that infect us have little to no impact on our health/well-being. Why not?
  * Most viruses just pass through us. (Many non-animal viruses are injested with food)

  * Beneficial viruses.
  * We have an amazing immune system.

### Course Goals

1) See the 'big picture' of virology.
2) Virology is an integrated discipline, not an isolated collection of viruses, diseases and genes.
3) Fundamentals of the viruses.

### What is a Virus?

> A virus is an infectious, obligate, intracellular parasite comprising genetic material (DNA/RNA), often surrounded by a protein coat, sometimes a membrane.

| Term | Meaning |
|------| --------|
| Infectious | Viruses can move from host to host. |
| Obligate Intracellular | Viruses have to get inside a cell in order to reproduce. |
| Parasite | Occupies a cell and takes essential stuff (nutrients), thereby damaging it. |
| Protein shell/membrane | **Often** surrounded by a protein shell. Viroids don't have protein coats and some viruses (coronaviruses) have membranes |

* We need to avoid anthropomorphic analyses of viruses. They don't think, they don't have goals etc. **The only selective force for a virus is to find a new host**.

* Viruses are not all small. Some of the more recently discovered ones are relatively big.

* Viruses replicate by assembly of pre-formed components into many particles as opposed to binary fission like normal cells or bacteria. This gives rise to an incubation period where nothing seems to happen.

### Virus Classification

* Nature and symmetry of nucleic acid in virion.

* Symmetry of protein shell (capsid).

* Presence/absence of lipid membrane (envelope).

* Dimensions of virus particle.

There is an underlying simplicity and order to viruses because of two simple facts:

1) All viral genomes are obligate molecular parasites that can only function after they replicate in a cell.

2) All viruses must make `mRNA` that can be translated by host ribosomes (they are all parasites of the host protein synthesis machinery).

## Lecture 2: The Infectious Cycle

The Infectious Cycle is everything that happens from when a virus attaches to a cell and new viruses come out at the end of the cycle. Other names: reproductive cycle, replicative cycle.

The steps of the infectious cycle are:

  1) **Attachment and entry**: Viruses attach to very specific receptors on the cell surface and are brought into the cell.
  2) **Translation**: The `mRNA` is made and translated into proteins.
  3) **Genome replication**: Multiplication of viral genomes.
  4) **Assembly**: Viral proteins + viral genomes
  5) **Release**: Out in search of a new cell

Some important definitions:

* **Susceptible cell**: Cell has a functional receptor for a given virus - _the cell may or may not be able to support viral replication_.
* **Resistant cell**: Cell has no receptor - _it may or may not be able to support viral replication_.
* **Permissive cell**: Cell has the capacity to replicate virus - _it may or may not be susceptible_.
* **Susceptible and Permissive cell**: The only kinds of cells that can take a virus particle and replicate it.

### How does one know if a particular cell is infected?

One way is to look at them through a light microscope and looking for the [_cytopathic effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathic_effect) (CPE).

| ![HeLa Cells infected with Poliovirus](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amr_Gamil2/publication/275258175/figure/fig1/AS:294613517651971@1447252744541/Cytopathic-effects-in-CHSE-cells-Development-of-cytopathic-effect-in-CHSE-214-cells.png) |
|:--:|
| *HeLa cells infected with polioviruses, note the structural changes with time* |

Another way is to look for the formation of the [_syncytia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium). These are just two ways of identification and there are many others depending on the type of virus particle involved.

### How many viruses are there in the sample?

We've now identified that the virus is replicating and isolated the supernatant. How do we know how much virus is there in the supernatant?

* There are two ways to do this, we can either measure infectivity or we can measure physical properties of virus particles and their components.

* We can use a [_plaque assay_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_quantification#Plaque_assay) and quantify the virus. _Note: The Wikipedia link has all that we need to know about the method and reagants used._ The agar is important because it restricts the movement of the virus, if we just had fluid, the virus would move too fast for us to view the plaque formation (restricts viral diffusion after lysis of infected cells).

Sometimes, the viruses don't kill the cells and we can't see the plaques. So we add a gene to their genome that adds a colour and count the coloured plaques instead.

### How many viruses are needed to form a plaque?

If we are going to measure the virus titer by a plaque assay, we have to make sure that one virus will make a plaque. We use a dose-response curve to solve this problem.

| ![Dose-Response Curve](https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dose-response-plaque-assay-1018x1024.jpg) |
|:--:|
| _Dose-Response Curve_ |

### What do we do for viruses that do not form a plaque?

* There is one method called the Endpoint dilution assay. Serial dilutions of a virus stock are prepared and inoculated onto replicate cell cultures, the number of cell cultures that are infected is then determined for each virus dilution, usually by looking for cytopathic effect.

* After an incubation period, plates that display cytopathic effects are scored with a `+`. At high dilutions, none of the cell cultures are infected because no particles are present. At low dilutions, every cell culture is infected. We need to find the dilution of virus at which 50% of the cell cultures are infected.

The results are expressed as 50% lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) per ml or 50% paralytic dose (PD<sub>50</sub>) per ml when lethality or paralysis are used as end points.

### Particle/PFU Ratio

* Particle/PFU Ratio = # of physical particles / # of infectious particles

The term particle/PFU ratio refers to the number of viral particles required to form one plaque in a plaque assay. It is a measure of the efficiency by which a virus infects cultured cells. **Not all virus particles are infectious**. For example, the poliovirus has a ratio between 30 to 1000 while Semliki forest virus has a ratio of 1 or 2.

* A single particle _can_ initiate infection.

* Not all viruses are successful though
  * Damaged particles (broken during assembly et al.)
  * Mutations

**INCUBATION PERIOD AND ECLIPSE PERIOD ARE NOT THE SAME**

### Single Step and Multi Step Growth Curves

If we infect all the cells in one go, the virus will have a traditional growth curve with an eclipse period and stuff. But what happens in real life is that the virus particles never attack all the cells at one time. So we have, in reality, a multi-step growth curve that has multiple bursts with multiple eclipse periods.

* Synchronous infection is the key to one-step growth cycles. But how do we know if we've infected all the cells?

#### Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)

* Number of infectious particles added per cell.
* Amount of virus (PFU) / # of cells

This is different from the number of particles each cell recieves. If 10<sup>7</sup> virus particles are added to 10<sup>6</sup> cells. We have an MOI of 10, but each cell doesn't get 10 virus particles.

* Infection depends on the random collision of virus particles and cells. Best described by the Poisson Distribution.

## Lecture 3: Genomes and Genetics

[Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v1). _The following line is from the paper, where we can see real-time applications of what we learned in the previous lecture_

> We then successfully isolated the virus (named nCoV-2019 124 BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019), in Vero and Huh7 cells using BALF sample from ICU-06 patient. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed in cells after three days 126 incubation.

### The Hershey-Chase Experiment

Initially, the scientists studying virus particles thought that proteins carried genetic information. This was based on the belief that proteins were more complex than `DNA`. _For example, `DNA` in humans have only 4 bases, how could it carry that much of information_.

* Viruses were known to be composed of a protein shell and `DNA`, so they chose to uniquely label each with a different elemental isotope.

* Since phosphorus is contained in `DNA` but not amino acids, radioactive phosphorus-32 was used to label the `DNA` contained in the T2 phage. Radioactive sulfur-35 was used to label the protein sections of the T2 phage, because sulfur is contained in protein but not `DNA`.

| *Structural Overview of T2 Phage* |

* Hershey and Chase inserted the radioactive elements in the bacteriophages by adding the isotopes to separate media within which bacteria were allowed to grow for 4 hours before bacteriophage introduction.

* When the bacteriophages infected the bacteria, the progeny contained the radioactive isotopes in their structures.

* This procedure was performed once for the sulfur-labeled phages and once for phosphorus-labeled phages.

* The labeled progeny were then allowed to infect unlabeled bacteria. The phage coats remained on the outside of the bacteria, while genetic material entered.

* Disruption of phage from the bacteria by agitation in a blender followed by centrifugation allowed for the separation of the phage coats from the bacteria. These bacteria were lysed to release phage progeny.

*Note: We now know that some phages completely enter the bacteria like `E. Coli` but it was a fortunate coincidence that the T2 phages didn't do so.*

* **The progeny of the phages that were labeled with radioactive phosphorus remained labeled, whereas the progeny of the phages labeled with radioactive sulfur were unlabeled**. Thus, the Hershey–Chase experiment helped to confirm that `DNA`, not protein, is the genetic material.

### Number of Viral Genomes

There are thousands of different virions, and it seems that there is an infinite complexity of infections. But the number of viral genomes is finite, in fact, it is my favourite number: **7**.

One of the reasons for this is all viruses or viral genomes have to make `mRNA` that can be translated by the host ribosomes. This constraint causes the limit. _I have to admit, this doesn't exactly give a proper answer. What is the relation between the constraint on the `mRNA` and the number of viral genomes? I couldn't find an answer anywhere and I've written a mail to Prof. Racaniello. I'll update it once I get an answer._

#### [The Baltimore System: Simplifying Virus Classification](https://www.virology.ws/2009/08/12/simplifying-virus-classification-the-baltimore-system/)

Virologist [David Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baltimore) devised an alternative classification scheme that takes into account the nature of the viral nucleic acid.

All viruses **must** direct the synthesis of `mRNA` to produce proteins. No viral genome encodes a complete system for translating proteins; therefore all viral protein synthesis is completely dependent upon the translational machinery of the cell.

| ![Baltimore System](https://www.virology.ws/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/baltimore-classification.jpg) |
|:--:|
| *Baltimore System* |

| Class | Type | Remarks |
|----|---|---|
| 1 | Double-stranded `DNA` | We can make `mRNA` from this |
| 2 | Single-stranded `DNA` | Double-stranded `DNA` is made from this and then to `mRNA`. **Single-stranded `DNA` is not a template for `mRNA` synthesis** |
| 3 | Double-stranded `RNA` | Both the messenger and anti-messenger `RNA` |
| 4 | `+ RNA` | In some cases, we can translate it directly but we need to go through a `- RNA` to make more of it. |
| 5 | `- RNA` | It must first be transcribed into a positive-sense `RNA` that acts as an `mRNA`. |
| 6 | `+ RNA` | Unusual in the sense that it is converted to `DNA` which is then converted to double-stranded `DNA` |

*Note: When originally conceived, the Baltimore scheme encompassed six classes of viral genome, as shown in the figure.  Subsequently the gapped `DNA` genome of hepadnaviruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus) was discovered.*

A few definitions that will help make more sense follow:

* `mRNA` is always the `+` strand.
* `DNA` of equivalent polarity is also the `+` strand.
* `RNA` and `DNA` complements of `+` strands are `-` strands.
* Not all `+ RNA` is `mRNA`!

#### In conclusion: The Seven Classes of Viral Genomes

* Double Stranded `DNA`

* Gapped Double Stranded `DNA`

* Single Stranded `DNA`

* Double Stranded `RNA`

* Single Stranded `+ RNA`

* Single Stranded `- RNA`

* Single Stranded `+ RNA` with `DNA` intermediate

| *Baltimore System with Examples* |

### What information is encoded in a viral genome?

Gene products and regulatory signals for:

* Protein synthesis (mainly giant viruses)
* Replication of the viral genome
* Assembly and packaging of the genome
* Regulation and timing of the replication cycle
* Modulation of host defenses
* Spread to other cells and hosts.

### What information is NOT encoded in a viral genome?

* No genes encoding the complete protein synthesis machinery
* No genes encoding proteins involved in membrane biosynthesis
* No classical centromeres or telomeres found in standard host chromosomes
* Probably we haven’t found them yet - 90% of giant virus genes are novel.
