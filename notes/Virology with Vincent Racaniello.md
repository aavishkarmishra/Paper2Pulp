# [Virology Lectures by Vincent Racaniello, (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhmZX2NKiNldpyRUBBEzNoWL0Cso1jip)

## Lecture 1: What is a Virus?

* Just like we have a microbiome, we also have a virome.
* The human genome has 3.2 billion bases out of which 8.3% are LTR transposons (remainders of retroviruses).
* Amazingly, the vast majority of the viruses that infect us have little to no impact on our health/well-being. Why not?
  * Most viruses just pass through us. (Many non-animal viruses are injested with food)

  * Beneficial viruses.
  * We have an amazing immune system.

### Course Goals

1) See the 'big picture' of virology.
2) Virology is an integrated discipline, not an isolated collection of viruses, diseases and genes.
3) Fundamentals of the viruses.

### What is a Virus?

> A virus is an infectious, obligate, intracellular parasite comprising genetic material (DNA/RNA), often surrounded by a protein coat, sometimes a membrane.

| Term | Meaning |
|------| --------|
| Infectious | Viruses can move from host to host. |
| Obligate Intracellular | Viruses have to get inside a cell in order to reproduce. |
| Parasite | Occupies a cell and takes essential stuff (nutrients), thereby damaging it. |
| Protein shell/membrane | **Often** surrounded by a protein shell. Viroids don't have protein coats and some viruses (coronaviruses) have membranes |

* We need to avoid anthropomorphic analyses of viruses. They don't think, they don't have goals etc. **The only selective force for a virus is to find a new host**.

* Viruses are not all small. Some of the more recently discovered ones are relatively big.

* Viruses replicate by assembly of pre-formed components into many particles as opposed to binary fission like normal cells or bacteria. This gives rise to an incubation period where nothing seems to happen.

* **How old are viruses?**

### Virus Classification

* Nature and symmetry of nucleic acid in virion.

* Symmetry of protein shell (capsid).

* Presence/absence of lipid membrane (envelope).

* Dimensions of virus particle.

There is an underlying simplicity and order to viruses because of two simple facts:

1) All viral genomes are obligate molecular parasites that can only function after they replicate in a cell.

2) All viruses must make `mRNA` that can be translated by host ribosomes (they are all parasites of the host protein synthesis machinery).
