# [When somebody loses weight, where does the fat go?](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7782)

Before I start off, I found this paper on [Andrej's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/) which is so reminiscent of his teaching style. It doesn't get better than this.

I generally do not recommend TED Talks but [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlsN32WaE) is pretty good, it is by the same author. A final disclaimer is that the paper is only **three pages long**. So please read it by yourself and ignore everything I write underneath. Let's get into the paper now, it's extremely interesting.

## Abstract

* Considering the soaring overweight and obesity rates and strong interest in this topic, there is surprising ignorance and confusion about the metabolic process of weight loss among the general public and health professionals alike.

## Weight we want to "lose"

* People who wish to lose weight while maintaining their fat-free mass are, biochemically speaking, attempting to metabolise the triglycerides stored in their adipocytes.

* The three most common fatty acids stored in human adipose tissues are **oleate** (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), **palmitate** (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and **linoleate** (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which all esterify to form C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.

* The complete oxidation of a single triglyceride molecule involves many enzymes and biochemical steps, but the entire process can be summarised as: **C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+78O<sub>2</sub>→55CO<sub>2</sub>+52H<sub>2</sub>O+Energy**.

* Stoichiometry shows that complete oxidation of 10 kg of human fat requires 29 kg of inhaled oxygen producing 28 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> and 11 kg of H<sub>2</sub>O. This tells us the metabolic fate of fat but remains silent about the proportions of the mass stored in those 10 kg of fat that depart as carbon dioxide or water during weight loss.

* To calculate these values, we traced every atom’s pathway out of the body using labelled heavy oxygen (O<sup>18</sup>).

* A triglyceride’s six oxygen atoms will therefore be shared by CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the same **2:1 ratio** in which oxygen exists in each substance. In other words, four will be exhaled and two will form water.

### Novel Calculation

* The proportion of oxygen that becomes CO<sub>2</sub> is **(661 Da (C<sub>55</sub>)+64 Da (O<sub>4</sub>))/(861 Da (C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>))×100=84%**

* The proportion of mass that becomes water is **(105 Da (H<sub>104</sub>)+32 Da (O<sub>2</sub>))/(861 Da (C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>))×100=16%**

### Lifting the veil on weight loss

* Calculations show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for fat. Losing weight requires unlocking the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that often heard refrain of “eat less, move more.”

* The authors recommend these concepts be included in secondary school science curriculums and university biochemistry courses to correct widespread  misconceptions about weight loss.
